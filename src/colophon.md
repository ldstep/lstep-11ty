## Colophon

This blog is a static site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), using [HTML and CSS](https://htmlforpeople.com/), and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). It automatically deploys whenever I commit changes to the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/ldstep/lstep-11ty). The domain is registered through [Hover](https://hover.com/).

When adding new posts, changing the design, or adding new features, that is done in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). New posts are written in Markdown in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) and added to a new post in VS Code.
