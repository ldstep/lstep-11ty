> Some advice if you’re starting a blog for the first time (or it’s been awhile):
> 
>  1. Share your thoughts on _whatever_. You’re a blogger, not an opinion columnist
>     in the washington post.
>  2. Change your mind! Write about why you changed your mind!
>  3. Write however you want. Run-on sentences. Weird grammar. Write in limericks,
>     sonnets, or haikus – defy the grammar cops.
