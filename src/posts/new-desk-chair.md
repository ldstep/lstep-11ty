My old chair was plastic, and the left support piece that connects the back to the seat broke. I lived with it for a couple of months because I was too lazy to look for a new one.

On Friday, I finally decided to get off my ass and get a replacement. I knew what I wanted and asked ChatGPT for recommendations. One of the suggestions was the Kroy Ergonomic Mesh Swivel Task Chair, Black (UN59456) from Staples. My local store had it in stock, so I hopped in my truck and picked it up.

The new chair offers an extra two inches of height compared to my old one. Now my hands sit slightly above the keyboard instead of below it. It's way more comfortable and much better for typing. Itâ€™s a fantastic improvement!
