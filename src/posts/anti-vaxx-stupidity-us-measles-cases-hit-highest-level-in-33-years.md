Well, this is just fucking GREAT. Measles is making a comeback. [The U.S. is having its biggest outbreak in 33 years](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health), with more than a thousand cases and counting, mostly because too many people decided vaccines are optional. “The measles milestone comes the same week that some of the[ nation's leading medical associations](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/08/nx-s1-5459978/rfk-jr-vaccine-pediatrics-public-health-lawsuit) sued Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., charging him with what they characterize as an effort to undermine trust in vaccines among the American public.”

Texas is leading the charge, and summer travel is helping measles spread across the country.
