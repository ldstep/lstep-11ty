> Unplatform is an interactive guidebook, online library, and recommendations database intended to help you escape social media and join the indie web.

I’m not on social media, but I’m a big fan of having your own space on the indie web. If you’re thinking about quitting social media, this guidebook is definitely worth checking out.
