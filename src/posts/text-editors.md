I’m tinkering with editors to write blog posts that integrate with my 11ty site. Posts need front matter and must be in Markdown, so the editor has to load my 11ty project and let me drop new posts into the right folder. It also needs to play nice with GitHub Desktop. Since I’m not coding anymore,just writing Markdown, I don’t need anything fancy.

Right now, I’ve only got two editors installed that do the job: BBEdit and VS Code. I’ve tried writing Markdown in VS Code, but honestly, it’s a shitty experience. I also gave Sublime Text a shot, but it takes too much setup and learning, and it’s $99. Not worth it for me. So for now, I’m sticking with BBEdit.
