> Please, someone in American television, break the McEnroe grip on tennis microphones. Belching up words is not broadcasting, a craft John McEnroe never learned. Johnny Mac has become an entitled air quaffer, a lapsed past master turned trifler who refuses to work at it. Witness how he tends to butcher the names of anyone not ranked in the top five. As for younger brother Patrick, he burps out banalities with the same offbeat affect as his bro, apparently believing it passes for alert observation. You need Pepto after listening to them for two hours.[…] Coupled in the ESPN broadcast booth at Wimbledon this week, they have given the viewer about as much information as a couple of air compressors, complete with the irritating hissing

And he can just leave his opponent with their jockstrap on the ground,” Agassi said. “I mean, look at this: He can go either direction with it. Because, in tennis, power and control comes from time spent on racket with the ball. … You’ve got more power, you’ve got more control, and you’ve got more deception.” The McEnroes show none of this acumen[…]

There was a time when I was really into tennis. These days, I’m mostly just a casual TV watcher. I caught Agassi’s commentary during this year’s French Open—it was captivating. I have to agree with this article: it’s time for John McEnroe to go. There are too many other great options out there.
