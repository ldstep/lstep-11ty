The runt of the baby chicks didn’t make it. She was struggling yesterday. We rerouted the heat lamp to keep everyone warmer. We worked with her, giving her vitamin boosts, helping her eat and drink, but she just couldn’t fight this morning. We’re sad! Amazing how quickly they become pets that you love. RIP, little one.
