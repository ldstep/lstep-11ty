> Having an ignorant conspiracy nut lead the Department of Health and Human Services is angering and worrisome, to say the least. But it’s also incredibly frustrating, because Donald Trump himself isn’t an anti-vaxxer. In fact, one of the few great achievements of the first Trump Administration was [Operation Warp Speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Warp_Speed), a highly successful effort spearheaded by the US federal government to “facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.” […] But instead, while plotting his return to office, Trump smelled opportunity with the anti-vax contingent [of the out-and-proud Stupid-Americans](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/27/trump-stupid-americans), and now here we are, with a genuine know-nothing lunatic like RFK Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services. God help us if another pandemic hits in the next few years.

This has me worried. Will I even be able to get my flu and COVID shots this fall? I’m a senior. Seniors' get the high-dose version for extra protection. But sure, let’s gamble with seniors’ lives. What could go wrong? With this fucking whack job running Health and Human Services, America’s about to get a whole lot sicker.
