Writing without an audience might feel pointless. It isn’t just about being read; it’s about thinking more clearly. Putting thoughts into words forces us to process them in a way passive consumption doesn't.

But most of all, write because your voice matters even if only to you. And if just one person finds what you write useful, then that makes it even more worthwhile. I think about the things I’ve read that have stuck with me, and I hope my words can do the same for someone else.
