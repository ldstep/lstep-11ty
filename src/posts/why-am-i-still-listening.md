There's a tech podcast that I listen to (not naming names) with three hosts. One of them is a smug, know-it-all asshole who makes the show almost unbearable at times. So why do I keep listening? Well, because the other two are great, and I often learn something.

I've deleted the podcast from my feed more than once, and I'll probably do it again. Today's episode, during my walk, pushed me right back to that point.
