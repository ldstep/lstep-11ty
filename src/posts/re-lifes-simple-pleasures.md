Lou Plummer, [writing about one of life’s simple pleasures](https://louplummer.lol/life-s-simple-pleasures/), said, “Give me a styrofoam tray of authentic tacos from a trailer in a convenience store parking lot selling authentic Mexican street food, and I will be happy.” This made me realize how much I miss good Mexican food. My favorite meal: two cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. When I lived in Southern California, I knew all the best spots for excellent Mexican food. Seven years ago, we moved to New Jersey, and I’m still searching for a place that serves real, authentic Mexican food.
