Some quick thoughts on the future of the iPad. Since the iPad launched in 2010, it's been the go-to device for kids. It's safe, simple, great for games, learning, and videos. These [iPad kids](https://www.parents.com/what-are-ipad-kids-8692488) have grown up with it as their first computer.

It's [estimated](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/04/tablets-more-common-in-households-with-children.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) that a significant portion of iPad users are kids and families. Around 80% of U.S. households with children own tablets, including iPads. This high rate of ownership shows that tablets are popular among families with kids under 18.

So what happens when those iPad kids become adults? The oldest are maybe 15 now. We don't know what they'll choose as adults. Maybe they'll stick with the iPad because it's the computer they know. For them, simplicity isn't a drawback, it's how computers work. That's the open question that will shape the future of the iPad.

I don't think the future of the iPad will be determined by those who started on the Mac, went iPad, and are now going back to the Mac after hitting iPadOS limitations and want Mac like features. I think the iPads future will be determined by those kids who have grown up using an iPad.
