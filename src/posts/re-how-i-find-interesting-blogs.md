I like this conversation so I thought I would chime in: it revolves around how different bloggers discover new blogs. [Barry Hess](https://micro.bjhess.com/2024/09/13/i-appreciate-personal.html) mentions submitting his blog to various directories but notes limited traffic from them. [JRN](https://jrn.sh/post/how-i-find-interesting-blogs)responds, saying they prefer discovering blogs through bloggers linking to or responding to each other, social platforms like Mastodon, and blog exploration features on platforms like Micro.blog. And [Chris](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/re-how-i-find-interesting-blogs/) at “uncountable thoughts” echoes JRN’s sentiment, emphasizing that blog directories aren’t heavily used for discovery; instead, contextual cross-linking between blogs is a more effective method.

I’m relatively new to the indie blogging, so I’m always on the lookout for new blogs to follow. What works best for me is when I come across a blog that references another one I almost always click through, check out the “About” page, and skim the article archives to see if their content interests me. If it does, I’ll add their blog to my RSS feed.

For instance, if you’ve stumbled upon this blog post, you have the chance to discover three new blogs, in addition to mine!
