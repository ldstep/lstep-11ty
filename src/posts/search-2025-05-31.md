Hey friends, when I'm looking for an answer or doing research, I rarely use Google anymore. I've been using ChatGPT instead. Depending on what I'm after, it can take forever to dig through Google results to find what I need. ChatGPT just gets to the point. ChatGPT also learns about me. It knows I use Netlify, so when I ask a question about it, I don't have to explain much, it just knows.

And yes, there are privacy concerns. But let's be honest, Google has been collecting our data for years. I do what I can to protect my privacy, but it's already out there.

I get that some folks are wary of AI, but it's not going anywhere. We might as well lean into it.
